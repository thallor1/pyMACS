Welcome to pyMACS's documentation!
==================================

**pyMACS** is a python interface to a mcStas simulation of the MACS instrument. 
There are a few steps to get the package running, but most importantly this must be run on a *unix machine with a bash shell*. See :doc:`installation` for further information.

.. note::
   
   This project is not under active development and is experimental.
